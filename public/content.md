# Visual Texts

Multimodal texts encorporate things like music and videos. Below are some definitions and terms for some of the elements present in these texts and a personal example.

### Lines & Shapes

- Curved lines dance arond, organic shapes speak of nature and passion
- Angled lines represent power, similarly, geometric shapes represent structure or rigidity

### Light & Colors

- Hue is the choice of the specific color from a prism splitting light, while saturation is the amount of that specific color
- Red symbolizes blood, and speaks to anger and passion
- Blue symbolizes the sea, and evokes sadness, calmness, etc.

### Texture

- A smooth, apple iPhone oozes a premium feel, a rough leather jacket shows how tough it is

### Space & Contrast

- A small character placed in a large landscape promotes helplessness
- Sharp lines speak of barriers

### Perspective & gaze

- Gaze body language and character thoughts
- Perspective affects the empathy of the viewer: when placed higher up, the viewer feels powerful. Lower down, viewers look up to characters and feel powerless. At a level angle, we stand on middle ground with them

## The Importance of Non-Diegetic Sounds

- Diegetic sounds are produced by the scene, and nondiegetic sounds are the soundtracks added, which are often [given little attention](https://www.filmsound.org/articles/designing_for_sound.htm) but have a huge effect on the audience
  - For example, a consistent sound that a child hears in their childhood could be a source of comfort, but as an adult it could bring fear or longing

### [The Sound Illusion that Makes Dunkirk so Intense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY)

One sound effect has three different tones that all rise in pitch. The highest pitched tone gradually fades away, the lowest pitched tone comes into focus, and the one in the middle stays constant. This gives the illusion of an infinetely rising pitch. It's even used in the infinite staircase in Mario!

### [Lord Of The Rings: How Music Elevates Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7BkmF8CJpQ)

In lord of the rings, the fellowship theme is used to demonstrate the spirit or purpose of its members. For example, it's overpowered by a villanous theme if they're in trouble, sputters out when characters are uncertain, and rises up when there is hope.

## Camera movement overhaul

- pan - horizontal movement left and right
  - shows distance between two objects
- tilt - vertical movement up and down
  - show height between two objects
- dolly - camera follows the subject at a constant distance
  - gives and emphasizes a perspective
- dolly zoom - moves closer to the subject while keeping subject the same; optical illusion that changes amount of background captured

  - The sheer impossibility of it can represent paranoia, give visual cues, and establish relationships
- zoom - gives a sense of size and perspective. Tunnel vision could represent a narrow view
- pedestal - physically moving camera up
- hand held - urgent, live scenes often used by news crews
- crane shot - gives a bird's eye view
- follow - follows subject, and gives a sense of the pacing of the story
- aerial shot - is like the crane shot by done by a drone
  - can give the viewer a good idea of the setting of the scnee
- rack focus - focusing out one person while simultaneously focusing in another
  - effectively changes the focus of the viewer

## Mise-en-scene

Positining of everything in an entire scene, and the mood and atmosphere it creates
